("HE LORD OF CROWS")
    ("A great ruffle of feathers spreads across the crow-mass like a wave in a black sea. A million beaks open in a single simultaneous caw that staggers you, wettens your ears with blood.")
    ("Images embed in your mind, so vivid that you suspect you will never be rid of them. Dead creatures of titanic proportions, with crows tearing wildly at their flesh.")
    ("The images are accompanied by a bolt of overwhelming hunger, a hunger like nothing you have ever felt.")
    ("Concerns updated: The Hunger of Crows.", "Logbook", 6)
    ("It is ancient. It hungers.")
    ("Your grovelling is met by an approving ruffle of feathers, spreading across the crow-mass like a wave in a black sea. A million beaks open in a single simultaneous caw that staggers you, wettens your ears with blood.")
    ("It seems to be a caw of approval. A strangely melodic note lingers, after the cacophony dies away.")
    ("Images embed in your mind, so vivid that you suspect you will never be rid of them. Dead creatures of titanic proportions, with crows tearing wildly at their flesh.")
    ("The images are accompanied by a bolt of overwhelming hunger, a hunger like nothing you have ever felt.")
