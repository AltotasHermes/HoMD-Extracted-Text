("Well, what a pleasure it has been to work with you these past weeks! Your writing is just perfect for The Pioneer - we are only a small magazine, but your articles have met with an overwhelming tide of approval from our loyal readers.")
("Of course, we couldn't ask for a greater marriage between our remit and your writing! You are an intercellular explorer of the kind that the City of Keys has produced for generations - a Keybearer, an entrepreneur, a pusher of boundaries and (if I guess correctly) an opener of locked doors! Why, you remind me of The Pioneer's founder, my grandfather, Lord Phosphorus Crumpett. He was an explorer of exactly your stripe until his tragic and senseless demise!!")
("Please, come and join us at The Pioneer. We offer a lovely atmosphere and all the baked goods you can eat. Our offices are on Upside, a delightfully quiet area of the city. As a full-time employee we will pay you considerably more than we could when you were a freelancer!!!")
("Unfortunately, we won't be able to accept freelance work from you until we have your answer. Which I'm sure will be yes! It will be lovely to meet you in person.")
("Kind regards,")
