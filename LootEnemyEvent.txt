        ("Success! In the wreckage you find a chest brimming with rubies and diamonds, a cache of precious stones beyond your wildest imaginings.")
        ("Your heart skips a beat. Could it be? With a reverent whisper you call over your crew, and haul the Key from the wreckage.")
        ("The pale hand amongst the wreckage could have been just another corpse, until you realize that it's twitching. You free from the rubble a dazed and wounded member of the enemy crew, somehow - and despite everything - alive.")
        ("As you turn to leave, you hear a hoarse voice calling for help. The helpless ghoul, trapped in rubble, almost sobs with relief when pulled free.")
        ("You notice a cloud of purple spores, hanging in the air like a distress signal. Rooting through the wreckage you uncover a squashed mycena, charred and unhappy but somehow still living.")
        ("As you turn to leave, you hear a weak bellow, and see a pile of rubble shift very slightly. Digging through the wreckage you discover a broken-limbed carchar, thrashing with strength born of pain.")
