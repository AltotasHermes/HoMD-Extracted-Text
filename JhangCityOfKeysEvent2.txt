    ("In Flea's Ear, Dungbird's Nest, Sootcup  - in fact, wherever creeping fungus has overtaken city architecture - the mycenae sleep restlessly. They wake with images of you and Jhang Ba Sho in their heads, urging them toward revolution.")
    ("Over the next week, a secret revolutionary cell is formed, calling themselves the Burnt Knights. They know they must be cautious when fighting the Governor; to be too obvious is to risk extinction. They liaise with the Unnamed Society, who are delighted to have finally found allies in the mycenae community - who they have courted for decades.")
    ("A month later, the meeting-house of the Society For Civean Purity is spectacularly blown up. The Burnt Knights promise to be a thorn in the Governor's side for many years to come.")
