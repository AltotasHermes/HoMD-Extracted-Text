    ("At the end of the evening, he takes you back to his small neat home on the outskirts of the Gardens. Laughing, partly at his jokes and partly at the thrill of taboo, you fall together onto the bed. Dead finger entwine mushily with yours. He plants small kisses all over your body, works his way up to your face, probes your mouth with his rotted tongue.")
