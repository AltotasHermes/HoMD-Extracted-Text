("We have been increasingly impressed by the articles you have submitted to The Key Details. We don't wish to unduly flatter you in case your head outgrows your talent, but you are certainly the finest of our current crop of freelancers. An intercellular traveller of your writing ability and general panache is quite the novelty, and notes of your wide-ranging travel make a fascinating contrast to the constant diet of insular city gossip which most publications offer.")
("You also have a sense of humour, which is our most serious requirement.")
("All this considered, we would like to snatch you and make you our own.")
("If you believe yourself ready to be snatched, please deliver yourself to our offices in Grief Street. A permanent position at The Key Details will pay much better than freelance work, and your salary will increase the longer you work with us.")
("We will be unable to accept freelance pieces from you until we have received an answer.")
("Yours impatiently,")
