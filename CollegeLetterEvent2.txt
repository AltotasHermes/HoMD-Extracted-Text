("Over the last week, I have heard many tales of your exploits exploring the House! I hope you don't mind me contacting you out of the blue - but I have an offer for you.")
("On your travels you are sure to come across many strange and valuable artifacts. You could merely sell them off to the highest bidder, of course, but you must recognize the profound blow that would inflict to academia. We have a unique opportunity. We could make your findings into a collection, and found a Museum of our own.")
("(If we could keep this venture secret from Paupers' College, at least until the grand opening, I would be grateful. They refuse to open their own collection of artifacts to the public, so I am taking matters into my own hands.)")
((("Perhaps foolishly, I have already leased a building on Broad Street. If you are on board with this venture, come and see me there so we may discuss our plans. Oh, and for a name? I was thinking 'The " + oPlayer.PlayerName) + " Memorial Museum of Unnatural Curiosity.' Not that you're dead yet, of course, but one day you will be, and then the name will make sense."))
