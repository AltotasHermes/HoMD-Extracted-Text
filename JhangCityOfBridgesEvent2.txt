    ("In the underhangs, mycenae sleep restlessly as you and Jhang Ba Sho march through their dreams, acting out a thousand years of oppression.")
    ("And the next morning, two thousand mycenae wake up with Jhang Ba Sho's booming rhetoric echoing in their spongy heads.")
    ("Within a day, there are mutterings of rebellion in the underhangs. A red flag is hung. Within a week, pro-mycenae graffiti appears across the City. Pubs and businesses known to harbour anti-mycenae fascists are burned down, or their windows smashed. A particularly bigoted Consortium Trader is killed.")
    ("Mercenaries and agents of the Clandestine retaliate swiftly. They burn down underhangs across the City, sending dozens - some say hundreds - of mycenae plummeting into the abyss. The survivors quickly surrender, and the nascent revolution fizzles out.")
