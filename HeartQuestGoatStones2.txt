Vague shapes in the surrounding shadows: At least a hundred goatmen, sitting cross-legged, each in their own circle, chanting in a guttural whisper.")

A knife-slash across his palm; he wipes his blood on the glittering treasure, and it melts as though soaked in acid. Molten gold trickles in all directions, tracing the network of circles.")
    ("The Heart reads from the grimoire in a booming voice. The prism unfolds itself into a numinous cage, which the Heart climbs inside. Shadows rise from all directions and wrap around the cage, until it and the man inside are lost in a cocoon of darkness.")
