("With you off embarking on your intercellular adventures, a thought occurs: Do you remember those long nights we spent in our youth, lamenting the College's pitiful lack of a public Museum?")
("On your travels you are sure to come across many strange and valuable artifacts. You could merely sell them off to the highest bidder, of course, but you must recognize the profound blow that would inflict to academia. We have a unique opportunity. With or without the College's blessing, we could make your findings into a collection, and found a Museum of our own.")
((("Perhaps foolishly, I have already leased a building on Broad Street. If you are on board with this venture, come and see me there so we may discuss our plans. Oh, and for a name? I was thinking 'The " + oPlayer.PlayerName) + " Memorial Museum of Unnatural Curiosity.' Not that you're dead yet, of course, but one day you will be, and then the name will make sense."))
