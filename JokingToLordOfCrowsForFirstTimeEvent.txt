("HE LORD OF CROWS")
    ("A great ruffle of feathers. A million beaks open and shriek in a cacophony that might be laughter. Your eardrums promptly explode.")
    ("When the laughter subsides, a crow detaches from the seething mass and flies down to your side. It hops to your shoulder, and caws gently in your bleeding ear.")
    ("Images embed in your mind, so vivid that you suspect you will never be rid of them. Dead creatures of titanic proportions, with crows tearing wildly at their flesh.")
    ("The images are accompanied by a bolt of overwhelming hunger, a hunger like nothing you have ever felt.")
    ("When you turn to leave, the crow hops after you. It seems you have gained a travelling companion.")
    ("Gained x1 Persistent Crow", "Cargo", 2)
    ("Concerns updated: The Hunger of Crows.", "Logbook", 6)
    ("(You passed a Spirit challenge!)", "Challenge", 7)
    ("It is ancient. It hungers.")
    ("Your joke is greeted by utter silence. Huh. Tough crows.")
    ("A flock of crows detach from the mass and descend upon you, ripping and tearing with beaks like iron. You are forced to run back to the kinetopede, torn half to shreds.")
    ("(You failed a Spirit challenge...)", "Challenge", 7)
    ("Crows pursue you to the door.")
