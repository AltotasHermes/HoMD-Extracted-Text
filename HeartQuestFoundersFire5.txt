    ("Inside the Tower it looks almost like a normal palace. Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, censers puff incense-laden clouds. The walls are covered in portraits of the Prince's Heart assuming various postures of triumph or contemplation. But walls, ceiling, floor - everything is silk, rippling, ephemeral. Occasionally the wall will billow up and flash you a sickening glimpse of the city miles below.")
